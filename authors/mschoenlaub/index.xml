      <description>&lt;p&gt;CircleCI is a widely used and extremely flexible continuous integration tool.
The new version, 2.1, was presented in July 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is designed to give you a cue about the new features that enable DRY pipelines.
I will focus mainly on the new concepts introduced in CircleCI 2.1.
Understanding them is crucial if you want to proceed any further. Buckle up!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The past weeks have been times of disruption for Europe and all the world.
In an effort to slow down the spread of COVID19, governments all across the world have implemented rigorous measures
curtailing public life, closing borders and in some cases even enforcing home isolation.
While the future will show how effective these measures are, the most immediate consequence
is that businesses and employees must now face the challenge - and recognize the chances - of temporary home office.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
